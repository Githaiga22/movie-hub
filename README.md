# Movie Hub

I‚Äôm building a Movie/TV Show Discovery Web App and I‚Äôd love your thoughts in improving this  project using:

    Backend: Go (Golang)

    Frontend: React with Next.js

    Design: A mobile-responsive and clean UI similar to Netflix, Amazon Prime, or MovieBox

Here‚Äôs a full breakdown of what I need help with:
‚úÖ Core Features to Implement

    Search Functionality

        Real-time search for movies and TV shows

        Debounced input to limit API calls

        Paginated results

    Detailed View Pages

        Show movie/show title, plot, cast, ratings (IMDB, Rotten Tomatoes, TMDB), release date, and posters

    Watchlist Management

        Users can add/remove items

        Mark titles as ‚Äúwatched‚Äù

        Stored in localStorage

    Trending Dashboard

        Show popular movies/TV shows fetched from the TMDB API

    Genre and Category Browsing

        Filter/search by genre

    Recommendation Engine

        Suggest content based on user‚Äôs watchlist history/preferences

    Dark/Light Theme Toggle

    Trailer Integration

        Use YouTube API to embed official trailers

    Export Watchlist

        Allow users to export their list as CSV or PDF

    Social Features (Bonus)

        Share favorite movies/shows with friends

üîß API Integration Requirements

    TMDB API (primary source for movie/TV data, images, trending content)

    OMDB API (additional plot + rating info)

    YouTube API (for trailer links)

Please help with:

    Handling API keys securely with .env

    Implementing error/loading states for each API

    Gracefully managing API rate limits and missing data

    Caching API results for better performance

‚öôÔ∏è Tech Stack & Project Requirements

    Frontend: Next.js + React

        Fully mobile responsive (styled like Netflix)

        State management (e.g. useContext, Redux, or Zustand if needed)

    Backend (Go):

        Handle all external API calls securely

        Provide internal RESTful API endpoints to frontend

        Middleware for logging, error handling, rate limiting, etc.

    Other Requirements:

        Clean, modular, and scalable code

        Setup with GitHub using branches:

            feature/search-and-discovery

            feature/watchlist-management

        Write at least 5 descriptive commits per branch

        Create pull requests and handle peer review feedback professionally

üìã Evaluation Goals

    Clean and efficient code architecture

    Proper use of Git and meaningful PR reviews

    Mobile-first UI/UX

    Clear documentation (README + API usage)

    Handling of missing/invalid API data

    Bonus if advanced filters, export, and social sharing are implemented

üéØ Please guide me through:

    Setting up the project structure (Go backend + Next.js frontend)

    How to fetch and manage data from TMDB and OMDB

    Best practices for API key management and caching

    Designing the UI like Netflix/Amazon

    Organizing code for maintainability

    Writing clean, readable Go and React code

    Handling error/loading states for all external data

    Creating sample watchlist logic with localStorage
